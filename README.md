#Rejection Detox: an App created by me, ironically spun by a rejection

Now rejection is something when the HR starts the conversation with "You are very talented but.....".This statement is apparently used to make the student feel better but irrespective of the way you are rejected or whether you deserved it or not ....it is going to break your heart.

This week the company I was hopeful of getting an offer, rejected me. Like any other person, I straight away went for the ice-cream tub and cried like a baby. People are going to say its not a big deal and we need to be strong and get back to normal. But the issue is we can't directly move back to normal. There is this small time frame in between called the window of pain which nobody talks about.

But as people know me, I always do things unconventionally so rather than sitting aloof in the corner of my room I thought let's make this window of pain interesting and super fun. So created an app in R called Rejection Detox.

Just tell your pain level and the app will try to make it better.

Based on your pain level, you will get a personalized message and inspirational or funny quotes. 
Based on where you live, the app will display nearby dessert places or bars(you chose) .(using Yelp API)
